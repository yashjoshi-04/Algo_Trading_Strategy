# Algo Trading Strategy Leveraging ARIMA-X

---

## üìñ **Introduction**

I aimed to build an algorithmic trading strategy that could **outperform SPY returns and CAGR** by timing buy and sell signals exclusively for SPY. 

This journey was not without failures. Before finding a successful strategy, I developed six different models that massively underperformed. My intent here is not to glorify quantitative trading but to provide a transparent view into the iterative process of creating a viable strategy.

> **Note:** More often than not, trading strategies fail before finding one that works.

Below is a snapshot comparing two failed strategies:
- **Red Line**: Mean Reversion using Gold Futures
- **Blue Line**: Simple MACD Strategy
- **Orange Line**: SPY Cumulative Returns (baseline)

## üßê **Rationale**

The objective was to leverage the **inverse relationship between commodities and equities** to generate buy/sell signals for SPY using adjusted closing prices of key indicators. 

### **Key Insights:**
1. **Gold and Silver Futures**: Not volatile enough to provide meaningful signals for SPY.
2. **Energy Futures (yfinance: `ES=F`)**: Exhibited both high volatility and a strong inverse correlation with SPY, making it a promising indicator.
3. **VIX Index (yfinance: `^VIX`)**: Captures downward volatility more effectively than SPY, allowing prediction of market downturns before significant impact.

## üõ† **Methodology**

### **Model Overview:**
- Developed an **ARIMAX model** with:
  - `^VIX` and `ES=F` as independent features.
  - Lagged values of `^VIX` to enhance trend capture.

### **Process:**
1. Train the ARIMAX model to capture the trend of SPY returns.
2. Overlay the **ARIMAX Predicted Trend** onto SPY actual cumulative returns.
3. Use the modeled relationship to generate **buy/sell signals**.

### **Visualization:**
Below is a comparison between the **ARIMAX Predicted Mean (Trend)** and **SPY Cumulative Returns**:
- **Red Line**: ARIMAX Predicted Trend
- **Blue Dashed Line**: SPY Cumulative Returns

## üìä **Performance Metrics**

After simulating the strategy with an initial capital of **$100,000**, the following results were observed:

## üí° **Conclusion**

This project highlights:
- The iterative nature of developing trading strategies.
- The importance of combining multiple indicators (`ES=F`, `^VIX`) for robust predictions.
- The use of **ARIMAX models** to generate actionable insights for SPY trading.

While the strategy succeeded in outperforming SPY, its real-world application requires continuous adaptation to dynamic market conditions.
